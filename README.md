# FPGA-Pesudocode
Verilog/HDL implementations of various circuits. These are all untested. Basically my workbook while I teach myself.

# Multislope ADC from HP
On Page 8 of the 1989 Vol.40 No.2 Hewlett-Packard Journal, there is an article by Wayne C. Goeke titled:
"An 8 1/2-Digit Integrating Analog-to-Digital Converter with 16-Bit, 100,000-Sample-perSecond Performance"
"This integrating-type ADC uses multislope runup, multislope rundown, and a two-input structure to achieve the required speed, resolution, and linearity."

# Pulse Width ADC from Solartron
On page 74 of the 1987 March issue of Electronics Today International, there is an article by ETI titled:
"SCRUTINY OF THE BENCH"
"Weighing up the evidence on the modern bench multimeter. Do they offer anything beyond the DMM you put in your pocket?"
