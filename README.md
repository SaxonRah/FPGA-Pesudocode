# FPGA-Pesudocode
Verilog/HDL implementations of various circuits. These are all untested. Basically my workbook while I teach myself.

# Multislope ADC
On Page 8 of the Hewlett-Packard Journal Vol.40 No.2, there is an article by Wayne C. Goeke titled:
"An 8 1/2-Digit Integrating Analog-to-Digital Converter with 16-Bit, 100,000-Sample-perSecond Performance"
"This integrating-type ADC uses multislope runup, multislope rundown, and a two-input structure to achieve the required speed, resolution, and linearity."
